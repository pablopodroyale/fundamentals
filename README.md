# Beginner

 1. [Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/description/)
 Given an array  `nums`. We define a running sum of an array as `runningSum[i] =     sum(nums[0]…nums[i])`.
2. [Richest Customer Wealth](https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/)
You are given an  `m x n`  integer grid  `accounts`  where  `accounts[i][j]`  is the amount of money the  `i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​`  customer has in the  `j​​​​​​​​​​​th`​​​​ bank. Return _the  **wealth**  that the richest customer has._

A customer's  **wealth**  is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum  **wealth**.
Return the running sum of  `nums`.

# Arrays and hashing

 1. [ContainsDuplicates](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/)
Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.
